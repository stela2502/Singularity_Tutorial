%help
    This Apptainer container includes:
    - Python with JupyterLab
    - R with Jupyter integration (IRKernel)
    - Based on Ubuntu latest

```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown:

## 1. BootStrap and From Directives:

```bash
BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest
```

- **BootStrap: docker:** This tells Apptainer to use a Docker image as the base for building the container. Docker images are convenient because they’re lightweight and pre-built for many common environments.
- **From: ubuntu:** Specifies that the base image will be the latest version of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a popular, stable Linux distribution with a vast ecosystem of packages and community support. Using latest ensures you’re always working with the most up-to-date version.

## 2. %post Section:

This section runs a series of commands to set up the environment inside the container. Everything in the ``%post`` section is executed after the base image is pulled.

```bash
%post
```

**a) System Update and Install Dependencies:**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget \
    curl \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    software-properties-common \
    dirmngr \
    gnupg2 \
    locales
```

- **apt-get update:** Updates the package list for the Ubuntu system so that the latest versions of software can be installed.

- **apt-get install:** Installs the specified packages.

    - wget and curl: Tools to download files and data over HTTP/FTP.
    - build-essential: A meta-package that installs essential tools for compiling and building software (like gcc, make).
    - libssl-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, libxml2-dev: Development libraries often required for installing Python/R packages (particularly those that involve networking, encryption, or XML parsing).
    - software-properties-common: Enables the management of software repositories.
    - dirmngr, gnupg2: Tools needed to manage and work with GPG keys (used to sign and verify software sources).
    - locales: Allows the configuration of system language settings.

**b) Set Locale:**

```bash
locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```
- **locale-gen en_US.UTF-8:** Generates the en_US.UTF-8 locale, which is a widely used UTF-8 encoded character set. It ensures that the environment supports a full range of characters, which is important for Python, R, and JupyterLab.

- **update-locale:** Applies the locale changes by setting the LANG environment variable.



**c) Install Python, Pip, and JupyterLab:**

```bash
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-dev
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install jupyterlab
```

- **apt-get install python3, python3-pip, python3-dev:** Installs Python 3 and its development tools (python3-dev), which are required for building Python modules and extensions.
- **pip3 install --upgrade pip:** Upgrades pip (Python's package manager) to the latest version to ensure that newer Python packages can be installed.
- **pip3 install jupyterlab:** Installs JupyterLab, a web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

**d) Install R and R Development Tools:**

```bash
apt-get install -y r-base r-base-dev
```

These are all ubuntu system packages - if you want another version of R you need to change this.

- **r-base:** Installs the core R environment.

- **r-base-dev:** Includes additional tools needed to compile R packages from source.


**e) Install R-Jupyter Integration (IRKernel):**

```bash
R -e "install.packages('IRkernel', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org
```

## 2. %environment Section:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export LANG=C.UTF-8
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE="true"
```

This part is one of the benefits of using ChatGPT - in all my definition files before that I have not set these variables and was rewarded by warnings messages at every step.

- ``LC_ALL`` and ``LANG``: Setting these environment variables ensures that the container's environment adheres to the specified locale settings when it's running.
- ``PYTHONNOUSERSITE="true"``: This env variable forces Python to install packages in the system's library path and not your personly Python library.



## 3. %runscript

```bash
jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```

This will start the jupyter web browser and write the connection details into the stdout of the slurm job.


## 4. %labels Section and 5. %help Section

Both of these sections are not necessary for the image to build, but would help us a lot if you would still maintain them!

The ``%labels`` section can be queried like that:

```bash
apptainer inspect <your_image>.sif
```

and the ``%help`` section like that:

```bash
apptainer run <our_image>.sif
```

You can see how a well maintained apptainer image can help both you and also us later on - not claiming that I have maintained my images well...
